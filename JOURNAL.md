June 5: (2 hours)
I came up with the project idea and started working on the schematic. I wanted to include OLED and ESP32 as well as a battery pack. 

June 6: (1 hour)
I looked at different ways to hook up the OLED. I have never done this before, so I had to switch out which OLED I was using due to an incompatability issue.

I finished the schematic and tried to make the PCB. I had a really hard time with the routing. I don't know why I can't route on both sides. If I don't, I am having a lot of errors with overlap of tracks. I watched a lot of YouTube videos but I couldn't figure it out. 

June 12: (1 hour) 
I rearranged the entire PCB because my routing still isn't working. I went back to my schematic and tried to use smaller components. I still don't know why I can't route it. I tried several times to do different configurations/combinations. 

June 17: (2 hours) 
I figured out that I can't route components that are on one side on the back of the board unless there are yellow circles on the PCB. Using this knowledge, I finished the PCB.

I started putting my files together and I made the CAD for the case. I also found a website that converts links to STL files of QR codes which is pretty cool. I used a link to my LinkedIn.
