June 5: (2 hours)
I came up with the project idea and started working on the schematic. I wanted to include OLED and ESP32 as well as a battery pack. 

June 6: (1 hour)
I looked at different ways to hook up the OLED. I have never done this before, so I had to switch out which OLED I was using due to an incompatability issue. 

June 10: (1 hour) 
I finished the schematic and tried to make the PCB. I had a really hard time with the routing. I don't know why I can't route on both sides. If I don't, I am having a lot of errors with overlap of tracks. I watched a lot of YouTube videos but I couldn't figure it out. 

June 12: (1 hour) 
I rearranged the entire PCB because my routing still isn't working. I went back to my schematic and tried to use smaller components. I still don't know why I can't route it. I tried several times to do different configurations/combinations. 

June 17: (1 hour) 
I figured out that I can't route components that are on one side on the back of the board unless there are yellow circles on the PCB. Using this knowledge, I finished the PCB.

I started putting my files together and I made the CAD for the case. I also found a website that converts links to STL files of QR codes which is pretty cool. I used a link to my LinkedIn.

I lowkey didn't know what I was doing and the CAD looked really stupid, so I decided to completely start over. I am now using an arduino nano because I understand arduino better, a MAX7219 because I like the shape, and two batteries (one 4.5V and one 9V). I made the schematic. I also decided that because I am completely lost on making a PCB I am just going to solder this myself at home. I do still need a CAD but only to hold the batteries. I started working on the CAD by importing a 9V battery model and a 3 AAA case for the 4.5V power source. I also downloaded CAD files for the MAX7219 and the arduino Nano.
